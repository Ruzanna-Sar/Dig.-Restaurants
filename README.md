# Dig.-Restaurants
[Dig Inn](https://www.diginn.com/) is an American chain of locally farm sourced restaurants that was founded in 2011.
Although Dig Inn has already demonstrated robust sales, the focus is now on gaining deeper insights into order trends to further enhance their understanding and performance.

## Objective
The main objectives of this project were to address the following business questions:

1. Identify the restaurant(s) with the highest order volume.
2. Determine the most popular order type among in-store, pick-up, and delivery. Investigate any delivery variations across the eight restaurants.
3. Identify peak and non-peak months and days, assessing whether these patterns are consistent across all restaurants.
4. Develop customer segmentation strategies for improved management purposes.

* pandas, numpy- for data analysis
* seaborn, matplotlib - for visualisation
* statsmodels,
* sklearn -for regression and KMeans analysis
